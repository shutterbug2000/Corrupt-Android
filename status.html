        <p>Status:</p>
		<p>October 19th, 2014:
		<p>What has happened to the project?:
		<p>As you probably noticed, this project has been seemingly dead for some time now. It's not. I haven't been actively working on it, but</p>
		<p>it's not dead. I've just been... very busy lately. School, and just other projects, have gotten in the way of my working on this. </p>

		<p>I still haven't even finished SNES, but you can be sure it will be completed soon.</p>
